[{"title": "Module 4 Assignment: New Business Idea"}, {"instruction": "BADM 350 Module 4 Assignment: New Business Idea\u00a0OverviewTwo-part activity: 10 points for business idea + 5 points for critiques/discussionTwo deadlines: one for Part 1 and another for Part 2\u00a0Part 1PurposeApply the concepts learned so far to come up with a new business idea leveraging Large Language Models such as ChatGPT or other generative AI tools that help with Image/Audio/Video creation or transformation. This could become the foundation of your project for this semesterAssessment10 points (2% of course grade). Rubric available from the gear icon on the top right.InstructionsThis is an individual activity. \u2028Create a post by using the reply button below. It's better to type it in a text editor and then copy/paste it here.Use the readings for this week and/or previous weeks, look at a list of such startups https://app.dealroom.co/lists/33530 or any other readings on the web to come up with a new business idea.You might want to consider business ideas relevant to the CU community and/or the campus, but that is not a requirement. You might also consider B2B applications, building on some experience you might have had in internships or casual summer jobs.Discord Bot interaction - Use Channel - Module 4-New Business Idea- You should describe your interests/ideas and/or any domains you are passionate about and ask the Discord bot to give you FIVE business ideas. Chat with the bot to improve the best idea. You submit only one idea at the end. Practice improving your prompts to the bot with these tips from Ethan Mollick. You can use parts of these instructions as part of your discussion with the bot. This is part of your grade.This idea should leverage the participatory nature of the \u2018Social Web\u2019 and or Web 3.0 and some of the principles discussed in the readings, such as network effects, developing platforms, crowd-sourcing, creating value from data, increasing switching costs, and selling to the long tail of demand, collaborative consumption, etc.\u2028 Consider this an idea challenge. This can also be considered a form of crowd-sourcing, with me being the VC, who is looking for ideas to invest in. The business idea must have some scope for monetization. This monetization need not be from direct sales or even from advertising. Think from a perspective of leveraging the data that you collect, if you can\u2019t monetize the idea directly.Your idea would most likely be a digital product/ service to apply the concepts we have learned. It could be a physical product as well but with significant discussions of the digital aspect.Your report should be prepared like an essay, 600 words (+/- 10%). It should have the following information in it:The IdeaWhat need does it fulfill? What goals does it serve? Why do you believe there is a demand for it?(this will need sources)How will you leverage some of the concepts discussed in the course to enter the market? How will you leverage what you have learned to grow this business? If there is some competition for your idea, why is your idea better?How will you make money?Any sources must be cited. This does not count towards the word limit. Cite the chatbot as well.\u00a0\u00a0Part 2PurposeCritique the submissions of others, learn from their ideas, and help them improve too.Assessment\u00a05 points (1% of the grade). Rubric available from the gear icon on the top right.InstructionsEach of you needs to review/critique the submissions of one other person, to help them improve their analysis, within 200 words (+/- 10%) each.When selecting a student to critique, do ensure that you pick one who has no critiques posted. If every student has a critique, pick one with LESS THAN TWO critiques posted.If your review takes time and/or you are posting the critique close to the deadline, someone else might post a critique before you, reaching the critique limit for that student.\u00a0 To avoid this, once you select a response to critique, just put a short comment on that submission, saying you are going to submit a critique. You can then submit the critique later(but before the deadline).Use the \"Critical Friends\" approach when writing your critiques as explained/used earlier.\u00a0Next StepsIf there are more items to be viewed or completed in this module, you can track them below.Module Item Completion (built in browser, hidden in app)"}, {"id": "_5733", "points": 5.0, "description": "Business Idea Creativity", "long_description": "", "criterion_use_range": true, "ratings": [{"id": "blank", "points": 5.0, "description": "Excellent", "long_description": "Presents a highly creative and innovative business idea that effectively leverages Large Language Models and generative AI tools for Image/Audio/Video creation or transformation.
